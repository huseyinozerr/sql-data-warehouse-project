 1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
 2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
 3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## About Me
Hi! I’m Hüseyin, a recent Mathematics graduate with a strong passion for data, analytics, and building scalable data systems. Throughout my academic journey, I developed a deep interest in problem-solving, logical reasoning, and working with complex structures — all of which naturally led me toward the world of data engineering.
I am currently focused on expanding my skills in:


SQL & database design


ETL/ELT pipelines


Data modeling (Star Schema, Kimball)


Python for data engineering


Cloud technologies


Modern data stack tools


I’m motivated by turning raw data into clean, reliable, and analytics-ready datasets that drive insights. My GitHub is where I share my learning journey, personal projects, and hands-on work as I grow into a professional data engineer.
Let’s build something awesome out of data!
