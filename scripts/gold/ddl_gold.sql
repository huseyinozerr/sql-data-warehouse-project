DDL Script: Generate Gold Layer Views
===============================================================

Script Overview:
    This script builds the views used in the Gold layer of the data warehouse.
    The Gold layer contains the finalized fact and dimension tables 
    organized in a Star Schema structure.

    Each view applies transformations and merges data coming from the Silver layer
    to deliver a refined, enriched, and analytics-ready dataset.

How to Use:
    - These views are intended to be queried directly for reporting 
      and analytical workloads.
